Hey there!

Simply extract the contents of the .zip archive in here, and drag the resulting folder "CC_CL-XXXX_XXXXXXXX" into `SD/update` using qflipper.

Then simply launch the "update" file on your flipper.


Theres also an "Animations" folder. In there you will find a few presets. After updating your flipper, you can move any of these folders into `SD/dolphin` using qflipper,
and enjoy some different animations.
