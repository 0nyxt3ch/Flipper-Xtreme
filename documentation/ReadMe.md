# Flipper Zero / Xtreme Firmware documentation

For some general information on Flipper Zero, check out [our wiki](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/wiki)!
It includes some useful [Generic Guides](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/wiki/Generic-Guides) for Flipper's main functions.
It also features an in-depth look at one of our most exclusive features: [Asset Packs](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/wiki/Asset-Packs).

If you instead are looking for some very detailed description of Flipper's ecosystem, OS, tools and file formats, please have a look at [Unleashed's documentation](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/tree/dev/documentation)!
